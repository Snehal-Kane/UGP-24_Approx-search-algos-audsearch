Pref  is a British graffiti fine artist and muralist.
 He is known for his multi-layered typographic style graffiti, incorporating an exploration of common words and key vernacular phrases.


Career 
Pref has developed his role and reputation as a graffiti artist over 20 years, and trained initially at Chelsea College of Arts before going on to work in graphic design His multi-layered style means that an element of deciphering is introduced, the viewer being asked to disentangle images and meanings from the artwork.
 The clear linear elements of his work and Pref's evolving interest in typography trespass across the borders of fine and graphic art in energetic and intriguing ways.

In 2019, he collaborated with Italian luxury fashion brand Fendi to create a capsule collection based on his designsHe also participated in an exhibition and event curated by Justin Bieber.
