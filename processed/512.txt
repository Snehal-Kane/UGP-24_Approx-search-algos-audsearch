is a 1975 Japanese experimental short film directed by Toshio Matsumoto.
 The film depicts a figure sitting in an outdoor environment and wearing a robe and a Hannya mask.
 The film features receding and shifting images captured in a frame-by-frame manner; though these shots resemble zooms and pans, they were actually derived from positioning the camera on a series of a points.


Reception
In 1978, a writer for the Millennium Film Journal called Ä€tman "an intricately constructed film", and compared it to Michael Snow's Wavelength (1967) and Hollis Frampton's Travelling Matte (1973)
