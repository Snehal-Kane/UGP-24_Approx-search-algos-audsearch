Lambda variant, also known as lineage C.
37, is a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
 It was first detected in Peru in August 2020.
 On 14 June 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it Lambda variant and designated it as a variant of interest.
 It has spread to at least 30 countries around the world and is known to be more resistant to neutralizing antibodies compared to other strains.
 There is  evidence that suggests the Lambda variant is both more infectious and resistant to vaccines than the Alpha and/or Gamma variant.
 



Mutations 
The Lambda genome has the following amino acid mutations, all of which are in the virus's spike protein code: G75V, T76I, Δ246-252, L452Q, F490S, D614G and T859N
