Legislative Process 

The legal system of the People's Republic of China is based on the older European legal system of Germanic civil law however the process of formulating the civil code has been full of twists and turns As early as 1954, after the promulgation of the first constitution of the People's Republic of China, the then government of the People's Republic of China immediately initiated a legislative project, namely the drafting of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China.
 However, the drafting of the "Civil Code of the People's Republic of China" has experienced four consecutive delays due to the subsequent anti-rightist movement and the Cultural Revolution.
 Until the "General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China (Draft)" passed at the Fourth Session of the Sixth National People's Congress on April 12, 1986, it marked the formal establishment of the first basic civil law of the People's Republic of China with the nature of general principles of civil law.
  Although there was still promotion afterwards, they were all formulated and implemented in the form of separate laws.
 It was not until the appearance of the "General Principles of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China (Draft)" passed in 2017, and the appearance of the various chapters of the Civil Code began to be compiled in 2018 that the "Civil Code of the People's Republic of China" was officially Introduced.
 On May 28, 2020, the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress voted to pass the "Civil Code of the People's Republic of China", scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2021.


First Draft 
The first drafting team of the Civil Code was set up in the research room of the General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and was responsible for studying the drafting of the Civil Code In the process of studying and drafting the Civil Code, the General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress did a lot of preparatory work.
 December 1956, the first People's Republic of China, "Civil Code draft" shape, the first draft of a total of more than 400 pieces, "General, ownership, debt, inheritance" four; then to 1922 " Russian Civil Code " as Basically, it excludes relatives from the Civil Code, does not stipulate property rights, and replaces the concept of natural person with the concept of citizenship .
 In 1957, the rectification movement and the anti-rightist movement began.
 On August 21, 1958, Chairman Mao Zedong of the CPC Central Committee stated at the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee in Beidaihe that civil and criminal laws would no longer be enacted; on December 20 of the same year, the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission stated in a report to the CPC Central Committee that there was no need to enact a civil law.


Second Draft 
In 1962, Mao Zedong addressed the issue of adjustment and improvement in the national economy, and proposed that "no law is not enough, criminal law and civil law must be developed Not only must laws be formulated, but also cases must be compiled", so the drafting of the civil code was once again placed on the agenda.
 In accordance with this instruction, in September of the same year, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress established a “Civil Law Research Group” headed by the Deputy Chairman and Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Director of the Law Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
 Under the auspices of the Law Office of the General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the drafting of the second civil code began.
 In the second half of 1964, the "Draft of the Civil Law (Trial Draft)" was completed and printed in a volume; this draft consisted of three parts: "General Provisions", "Property ownership", and "Property transfer", and a total of 24 chapters and 262 articles.
 Due to the nature of the central economic planning during, socialist education movement and the Cultural Revolution drafting of the Civil Code once again interrupted from 1965 to 1976.


Third Draft 
With the end of the Cultural Revolution and the commencement of the redress of unjust, false and wrong cases, the political situation in the People's Republic of China stabilized, putting the drafting of the Civil Code on the agenda once again The Legislative Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress established the Civil Code Drafting Group in November 1979, and began the third draft of the Civil Code.


In August 1980, the Civil Code Drafting Group drafted a "trial draft" of the civil law draft, and began to solicit opinions from some economic units and political and legal departments This draft consisted of 6 parts and 501 articles on general provisions, property ownership, contracts, labor remuneration and rewards, liability for damages, and inheritance of property.
 In September, the original " Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China " was revised to adapt to the new situation since the reform and opening up.
 However, since the reform and opening up of the People's Republic of China and the construction of economic recovery had just started at that time, the conditions for drafting a complete civil code were not mature enough in the short term, therefore the civil law was temporarily established and implemented as a separate law.


From 1985, oniwards the "Inheritance Law of the People's Republic of China", the "General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China", the "Civil Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China" and "Adoption Law of the People's Republic of China", were established and implemented successfully
