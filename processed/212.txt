Production
Director Erik Matti had originally intended the On the Job sequel to be a web series, until it was reported in 2018 that he was making it a feature-length sequel instead With On the Job 2, Matti wanted to tackle corruption in the Philippine media and deliver a social commentary on the current state of the Philippine government.
 According to Matti, the film will pick up where the original left off and will feature four interwoven storylines in "a three-hour and 28-minute movie".
 Erwin Romulo, reprising his role from the first film as musical director, has said On the Job 2 is Matti's "angriest work".
 Matti agreed, having told NME in a February 2021 interview:

I think for On The Job, I guessâ€¦ yes, it's the angriest I've been But what I do mostly in my films is to explore.
 I'm interested in processes: how does a newspaper get its news? How does one build a church in the guise of getting money from its parishioners? Those are things that matter to me.
 There's a lot of research that went into it.
 Of course, we found out that in small towns mainly you have politicians taking care of newspapers and radio stations, and that's where the problems with self-interest come in.


Dennis Trillo, Lotlot de Leon, Ricky Davao, William Martinez, John Arcilla, Dante Rivero, Vandolph Quizon, and Eric Fructuoso were reported to have joined the cast in 2018 In 2019, Rayver Cruz, Christopher de Leon, Soliman Cruz.
