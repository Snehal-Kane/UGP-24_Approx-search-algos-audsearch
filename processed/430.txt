Metyltetraprole is a quinone outside inhibitor fungicide sold under the brand name Pavecto by its inventor, Sumitomo Chemical.
 It is the only tetrazolinone fungicide and the only one in the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee's subgroup 11A.


Development
Metyltetraprole was developed specifically to find an ai.
 with the same mode of action (a QI) but with sufficiently different chemistry as to avoid "critical" QI resistance increasing around the world.


Target pathogens
Metyltetraprole is highly effective against Alternaria triticina

Resistance
Developed because of increasing resistance to the main group of QIs See Development above.


Cross-resistance
It does not suffer cross-resistance with the resistance against 11 conferred by the cytochrome b mutation G143A Cross-resistance against F129L is unassessed.
