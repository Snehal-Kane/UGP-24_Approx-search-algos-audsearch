History
The Flade Isblink was named by Lauge Koch in 1933 He was the first to map the area in the course of survey flights during the 1931â€“34 Three-year expedition to East Greenland.


Geography
This large and flat ice cap is separated from the Greenland ice sheet and is the largest independent ice cap in Greenland It is located between the Wandel Sea to the north and Amdrup Land and Antarctic Bay to the south.
 Romer Lake and the Princess Elizabeth Alps extend southwestwards at the western end and to the east lies the Fram Strait and the Greenland Sea.
 The ice cap covers most of the northern part of Crown Prince Christian Land and is about  in area.
 The underlying bedrock is roughly  above sea level.


The Flade Isblink has two ice domes, the North Dome and the larger South Dome Kilen is a roughly triangular stretch of unglaciated flat land in the eastern shore with its apex in the ice cap between the two domes.
 The northern section of the ice cap is drained by two outlet glaciers flowing in a roughly northwestern direction.
 The northeastern corner of Greenland, Nordostrundingen, extends into the sea at the eastern end.
