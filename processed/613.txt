"Build It Better" is a song by Australian singer-songwriter Natalie Imbruglia, released on 18 June 2021 as the lead single from her sixth studio album Firebird.


Natalie said the song is about "surrendering to the chaos and seeing what's on the other side of it is a good life lesson Letting something fall apart, and being okay with that, is something that I have had to do in my life, numerous times, but especially moving into this record and becoming a mum.
 So, I'm really excited about that song, and about the video, which is total escapist fun â€“ the world needs that right now.
