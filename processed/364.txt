Shannon W.
 Boettcher is a Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Oregon.
 His research is at the intersection of materials science and electrochemistry, with a focus on fundamental aspects of energy conversion and storage.
 He has been named a DuPont Young Professor, a Cottrell Scholar, a Sloan Fellow, and a Camille-Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar.
 He is a ISI highly cited researcher (top 0.
1% over past decade).
 In 2019, he founded the Oregon Center for Electrochemistry and in 2020 launched the nationâ€™s first targeted graduate program in electrochemical technology.
 In 2021 he was named a Blavatnik National Award Finalist.


   

Boettcher performed his undergraduate work at the University of Oregon performing research with Prof Mark Lonergan on electronically conductive ionomers and conjugated-polymer/semiconductor interfaces.
 His PhD work (2003-2008) in inorganic materials chemistry was at the University of California, Santa Barbara with Prof.
 Galen Stucky where he was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and a UC Chancellors Fellow.
 His work spanned the synthesis and study of porous transition metal oxides, photoelectrochemistry, and detailed studies of nanoparticle film electrochemistry and nanoparticle/semiconductor interfaces.
 Boettcher completed postdoctoral work at the California Institute of Technology as a Kavli Nanoscience Institute Prize Postdoctoral Fellow working with Prof.
 Nathan Lewis (Chemistry) and Prof.
 Harry Atwater (Applied Physics) studying three-dimensional semiconductor architectures for solar photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic applications.
 He started as an Assistant Professor at the University of Oregon in 2010.
 In the spring of 2012, a profile appeared on Boettcher's work, his background, and perspective in 'The Oregon Quarterly'.
