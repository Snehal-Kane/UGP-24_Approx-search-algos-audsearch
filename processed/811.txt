On 28 November, two cases of the Omicron variant were detected in Sydney Both people landed in Sydney the previous day, and have travelled from southern Africa to Sydney via Doha, Qatar.
 The two people, who are fully vaccinated, entered isolation; 12 other travellers from southern Africa also entered quarantine for fourteen days, while about 260 other passengers and crew on the flight have been directed to isolate.
 On 29 November, two more passengers which arrived from southern Africa via Singapore tested positive for the Omicron variant.


On 30 November, a positive case of the Omicron variant was recorded in Sydney The person had visited southern Africa before arriving in Sydney prior to travel restrictions, and was subsequently active in the community in Sydney and the Central Coast.
 By 3 December, a cluster including Omicron variant cases had developed in western Sydney, in the suburbs of Regents Park and Villawood.


December 
On 5 December, new daily case numbers dropped to a low of 208

On 16 December, due to the spread of COVID-19 Omicron variant in the area, NSW Health urged the Newcastle community to consider deferring social events till after Christmas

On the afternoon of 16 December the Lunar Electric Music Festival in Newcastle, scheduled for December 18, was cancelled by a Public Health Order This was done because the ongoing spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in that area was too high a risk.


After falling as low as 208 then gradually rising, on 13 December new daily case numbers began to rise quickly again By 18 December they had risen sharply for six consecutive days reaching what was then a new NSW state, and national, record of 2,566 new daily cases, before dropping slightly again to 2,501 on 19 December.


By 22 December, great difficulties in finding rapid antigen tests (RAT) for COVID-19 became apparent
 
On 23 December, NSW single-dose vaccinations reached 95%, and 935% double dose, for the 16-years and older community and the NSW government announced that on 27 December until 27 January 2022, QR code check-ins would again be compulsory, including in hospitality and retail settings.
 Also, hospitality venues such as cafes, clubs, pubs and restaurants would return to a 1-person per 2 square metre rule indoors, but no density limit in outdoor settings.
 
 
The same day, the state government also announced that they would source rapid antigen test (RAT) kits and distribute them for free

On 24 December, the states' new daily cases of COVID-19 rose to 6,288
 
Also on 24 December, mask wearing indoors again became mandatory

On 25 December, there were no deaths recorded, and new daily cases of COVID-19 rose to 6,394 Cases admitted to hospital rose to 458, 52 in intensive care, 15 on ventilation.


On 26 December NSW had 3 deaths, including its first death related to the Omicron variant, raising to 654 the states' total official COVID deaths All 3 people were in their 80s or 90s, had 2 doses of vaccine, and underlying health conditions.
 The Omicron death was a man from western Sydney, at Westmead Hospital.
 He was infected at Uniting Lilian Wells aged care in North Parramatta where he lived.
 New case numbers were down slightly at 6,324.
 Cases admitted to hospital were 520, with 55 in intensive care, 17 on ventilation, all more than the previous day.


By 27 December, NSW pathology services processed more than 24 million PCR tests but, as in other states, resources were being strained by "tourism testing" Consequently, on 29 December the NSW Health Department asked that people getting tested to travel interstate for holidays avoid going to COVID testing sites unnecessarily as it was unlikely they would get test results within 72 hours.
 If travelling to Qld, this would be after that states' 1 January  2022 changes to test requirements became effective and only a RAT test needed.


Priority for getting a PCR test was then given to those who:
• had COVID-19 symptoms or  – a positive rapid antigen test
• were a household contact of a confirmed case
• had been in a venue, for example a club, where there had been high transmission 
• had been in a setting with vulnerable people which was experiencing an outbreak, such as an aged care home

On 28 December there were 3 more deaths, raising the state total to 658, and new case numbers jumped by about 85% in 24 hours to 11,201 from 6,062 on 27 December

On 30 December there were another 6 deaths raising the state total to 665 They were 4 men and 2 women aged in their 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s.
 1 was not vaccinated, 1 had 1 dose, 4 had 2 doses of vaccine.
