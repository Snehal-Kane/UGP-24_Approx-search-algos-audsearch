The 1920 World Hard Court Championships (WHCC) (French: Championnats du Monde de Tennis sur Terre Battue) was the fourth edition of the World Hard Court Championships tennis tournament, considered as the precursor to the French Open, and was held on the clay courts of the Stade Français at the Parc de Saint-Cloud in Paris from 22 until 30 May 1920.
 Organised by L'Union des Sociétés Française De Sports Athlétiques, the Championships had been suspended in the prior five years due to World War I, and thus this was the first edition held since 1914.
