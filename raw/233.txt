Albarella has written numerous journal articles, book chapters and edited volumes.  Pigs and humans: 10,000 years of interaction, published in 2007, was the first major attempt at synthesising archaeological studies of pigs. The 2011 volume, EthnoZooArchaeology: The Past and Present of Human-Animal Relationships, was described as "important collection of papers for both ethnoarchaeologists and zooarchaeologists". Albarella and colleagues edited the Oxford Handbook of Zooarchaeology, published in 2017 and noted for its international breadth and thematic diversity.

He has supervised numerous PhD students, including Richard Thomas, Angelos Hadjikoumis, Angela Trentacoste, Lizzie Wright. Albarella has served on the editorial boards of the journals Anthropozoologica, Environmental Archaeology and Medieval Archaeology.
