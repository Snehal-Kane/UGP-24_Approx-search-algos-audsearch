Bear Lakes is a set of small freshwater lakes located on the southwest skirt of Canoe Peak, in King County, Washington. Several mines are located in the vicinity of Bear Lakes. Access is from Bear Creek Trail which continues along abandoned and mostly overgrown mine routes. Cable reels and other mining artifacts are frequent along the trail and in the surrounding areas of the lake. Lake Kanim is a short distance north over Canoe Peak towards Lennox Mountain, and Paradise Lakes are west of Bear Lakes.
