The 2022 Africa Women Cup of Nations qualification was a women's football competition which decided the participating teams of the 2022 Africa Women Cup of Nations, which in turn is part of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification.

A total of 12 teams qualified to play in the final tournament, including the hosts (Morocco) who qualified automatically.

Format
Qualification ties were to be played on a home-and-away two-legged basis. If the aggregate score was tied after the second leg, the away goals rule would be applied, and if still tied, the penalty shoot-out (no extra time) would be used to determine the winner.

Draw
A record total of 44 (out of 54) Confederation of African Football (CAF) member national teams entered the qualifying rounds. The draw was held on 10 May 2021 at the CAF headquarters in Cairo, Egypt.
In the first round, the 44 teams were drawn into 22 ties, with teams divided into four pots based on their geographical zones and those in the same pot drawn to play against each other.
In the second round, the 22 preliminary round winners allocated into 11 ties based on the first round tie numbers.
