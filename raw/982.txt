Pavel Nikolaevich Kazakov (, 19 February 1928–17 September 2012) was a Soviet football referee, who was the country's referee of the year on 15 occasions. He officiated the second leg of the 1973 UEFA Cup Final, as well as at the 1972 Summer Olympics and 1974 FIFA World Cup.

Career
Kazakov officiated over 100 matches in the Soviet Top League. In 1959, he was awarded the Master of Sports of the USSR. He was awarded USSR referee of the year on 15 occasions (from 1961–1965, and 1967–1976 inclusive), which was a record for a Soviet or Russian official. He officiated the 1973 Soviet Cup Final between Ararat Yerevan and Dynamo Kyiv, and the 1976 Soviet Cup Final between Ararat Yerevan and Dinamo Tbilisi.

Between 1969 and 1976, Kazakov officiated 12 matches in the European Cup, UEFA Cup and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. He officiated the second leg of the 1973 UEFA Cup Final between Liverpool and Borussia Mönchengladbach. Kazakov officiated at the 1972 Summer Olympics. He was the main referee for the match between Denmark and Brazil, and was an assistant referee in four other fixtures at the Games. He officiated two matches at the 1974 FIFA World Cup: the group stage match between Argentina and Italy, and the group stage match between West Germany and Sweden. In an interview, Kazakov said that he was considered as a referee for the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final, but overlooked due to the controversy of Soviet linesman Tofiq Bahramov at the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final.

In 1976, Kazakov announced his retirement from officiating.
