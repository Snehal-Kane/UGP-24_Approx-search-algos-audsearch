History 

The Foundation was founded in 1979 by doctors Michel Gélinas, Pierre Audet-Lapointe, Yvan Méthot, Maurice Falardeau and Pierre Band. The co-founders aimed to reduce the gap between the care provided to cancer patients in Quebec and that offered elsewhere in Canada and abroad, while cancer was not yet recognized as a priority by the medical profession, specifically in Quebec. Marco Décelles is serving as the head of the organization as of 2021. Musician Guylaine Tanguay is acting as the spokesperson of the organization. In 2020, University Hospital of Quebec announced its collaboration with The Quebec Cancer Foundation to support people suffering from cancer.
