1 Queen 5 Queers is a Canadian television talk show, which premiered on Crave in 2021. A revival of the 2009-2014 MTV Canada series 1 Girl 5 Gays, the series will feature a panel of LGBTQ people talking about LGBTQ issues, moderated by drag queen Brooke Lynn Hytes. According to Hytes, the series will represent a broader and more diverse array of participants than the original, which focused almost entirely on the perspectives of gay men.

The series debuted on December 9, 2021. Panelists appearing on the series will include choreographer Hollywood Jade, comedian Tricia Black, actor and athlete Harrison Browne, fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, and musician and writer Our Lady J.
