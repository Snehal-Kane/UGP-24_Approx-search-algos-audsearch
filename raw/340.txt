La Nueva Familia Michoacana is a criminal organization formed in 2011 after the original Familia Michoacana lost power in 2010 with the formation of Knights Templar Cartel and Nazario Moreno's suspected death (he was not proven dead until 2014 with a DNA test). It is dedicated to drug trafficking and battling the CJNG criminal organization out of Tierra Caliente. Many of its leaders have been arrested for threatening and blackmailing people on social media. La Nueva Familia Michoacana operates in the southern area of Mexico.

Social media threats
In 2019, a leader from the cell called El Zarco threatened El Mencho by telling him they were going to kill his hitmen by the Balsas River. The threat went viral that a few weeks later CJNG members threatened to assassinate El Zarco.
