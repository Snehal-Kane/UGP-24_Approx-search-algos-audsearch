Paleo-Laplandic is a hypothetical group of extinct languages spoken in Sápmi (northern Scandinavia). The speakers of Paleo-Laplandic languages switched to Sámi languages, and the languages became extinct around . A considerable amount of words in Sámi languages originate from Paleo-Laplandic, more than 1,000 loanwords from Paleo-Laplandic likely exist. Many toponyms in Sápmi originate from Paleo-Laplandic. Because Sámi language etymologies for reindeers have preserved a large number of words from Paleo-Laplandic, this suggests that Paleo-Laplandic groups influenced Sámi culture.

Due to irregular correspondences in Sámi loanwords from Paleo-Laplandic, it can be theorized that the words were borrowed from distinct but related languages that were characterized in the west by an s-type sibilant, while in the east it was an š-type sibilant.

Many words relating to the environment or reindeer such as ája ("spring") are likely loanwords from Paleo-Laplandic into Sámi. The Paleo-Laplandic languages are probably descended from the unattested post-Ahrensburgian (Komsa and Fosna-Hensbacka) languages. The substrate words have no apparent parallels to any known language. Yuri Kuzmenko compared them with the Pre-Germanic substrate words but found no similarities aside from a distinction between central and peripheral accentuation.
