The firm of Goddard & Gibbs were London-based English glassmakers and stained glass window manufacturers. The company was established in 1868, although one firm which it subsequently acquired had been established earlier, in 1855. Goddard & Gibbs itself was formed by a merger in 1938; the company continued to trade until it was acquired by Hardman & Co. in 2006. Hardman itself ceased to trade in 2008.

History

James Clark & Sons
Established by a James Clark in 1855, the firm was still trading at Scoresby Street, Blackfriars in 1900. Soon after it was acquired by Walter Gibbs & Son.

Walter Gibbs & Sons
The son of a glass stainer, John Gibbs, and his wife Elizabeth (née Booker), Walter Gibbs (1846–89) established his firm in 1868. His wife Sarah Ann Colwell (1847–95), and sons Walter Thomas (1870-1927), Arthur Augustus (1872-1938), Horace Albert (1877-1917) also worked for and with him. In 1910 the firm was trading at 210 Union Street, Southwark.

Goddard's Glass Works
A trader by the name of Goddard established a shop in Woolwich in 1933.

Goddard & Gibbs

The firm known as Goddard & Gibbs was formed as a result of the merger in 1938 of Walter Gibbs & Sons and Goddard's Glass Works. The merged firm kept its name despite subsequent takeovers by James Clark & Eaton Ltd and, in 1978, by Charles Clark. The firm and its predecessors all traded in Blackfriars, London, until it eventually operated from studios at 41-49 Kingsland Road in Dalston, London. Late in its history the firm moved to Marlborough House, Cooks Road, Stratford (subsequently demolished for Crossrail works at Pudding Mill Lane). In 2006 it was acquired by Hardman & Co., and ceased to have a separate identity. Hardman itself closed just two years later, and the Goddard & Gibbs archive appears to have been lost at that point.

A successor firm reviving the Goddard & Gibbs name was soon established, initially at Corsham, and subsequently at Trowbridge, Wiltshire, but which now focuses on lead window repairs.

The firm had an international reputation for contemporary stained glass as well as the restoration of older stained glass. Early in its history it advertised a unique ability to make embossed glass signs and showboards at 'the shortest notice'. After WWII the firm focused on replacement glass for bomb-damaged churches, as well as for churches in Canada, Ghana, New Zealand, Nigeria, Nyasaland, South Africa and the United States.
Goddard & Gibbs' designers included Arthur Edward Buss (1905–99), John Lawson (1932-2009) (who joined in 1970 from Faith Craft), Maud Sumner (1902–85), and George Cooper-Abbs (1901–66). Other designers later in the history of the firm included Caroline Swash, Zoe Angle, Chris Madline, Laura Perry, Louise Watson, Sophie Lister-Hussain and Sharon McMullin.
