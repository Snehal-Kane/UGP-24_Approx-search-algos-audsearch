Mayflower AI sea drone ,  or   Mayflower Autonomous Ship,  or  Mayflower 400  is  an autonomous research vessel planned to cross the Atlantic without human crew or assistance in 2021. It is named after the Mayflower sailing ship, that carried English and Dutch Pilgrims onboard from England to New England between September and November 1620. Taking the same route, it was originally intended to set sail in September 2020 in time for the 400th anniversary.

A three-week voyage is planned; the Mayflower 400 will sail from Plymouth UK , navigate  through the Isles of Scilly and over the site of the sunken Titanic to land in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The  Mayflower Autonomous Ship has a highly trained “captain” and a “navigator” knowledgeable in the rules of avoiding collisions at sea.   Both functions are controlled by artificial intelligence (AI). 

The 15-meter  long aluminium trimaran  is solar-powered and is capable of speeds of up to 10 knots (20km/h).  It has a back up diesel generator.  The  ship cost $1.3 million to build and is owned by the  not for profit marine research organization ProMare in partnership with computer-tech company IBM.  

The ship will sample the water for pollutants and study marine life during its voyage. It will also trial its computer systems.
